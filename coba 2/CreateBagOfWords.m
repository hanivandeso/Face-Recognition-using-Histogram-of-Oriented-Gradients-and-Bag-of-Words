%Creates a bag of words from a dataset.
%blockSize is the size of the cells in the HoG descriptors.
%patchSize is the size of the patches. Each patch is used for a HoG
%descriptor.
%directories is a cell array containing two directories with the training
%images.
%trainSetPercentage sets how many images are used for training, and how
%many are used for crosss validation.
